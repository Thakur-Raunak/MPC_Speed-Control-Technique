# MPC_Speed-Control-Technique
Implementation of model predictive speed control technique to control the speed of PMSM Drive(With Trapezoidal EMF) .
Designed the Simulink model of Drive and implemnted logic Using Matlab Function Block to produce Switching Vectors.
Implemented the Control Technique Using  discrete PI(z) controller and feedback loop to reduce the steady state errors to achieve the reference speed.
Used Clarke and Park Transformation Blocks to produce required current transformations.
Achieved a precision of 1 percent in steady state speed response.
